      Hello! My name is Kai Curtis and I'm a 25 year old male. I was born in
      Kansas, only to live there for 3 months before moving to a suburb of
      Washington D.C. until i was 3. After that we, being a military family,
      moved to Germany. we spent two years there before my mother, my sisters,
      and I came back to the States. We moved into a quiet town called Lynchburg
      in VA. I lived in that town from 1999-2016. In those 16 years I managed to
      pick up an absolute obsession for skateboarding which has since developed
      into my lifestyle. As time carried on skateboarding and delivering pizzas
      didnt seem like a suitable lifestyle so i came to colorado to persue the
      outdoors and a manufacturing degree. My two years spent getting my
      associates were a blast. I landed a raft guiding job based in Morrison,
      the water being clear creek. This company i worked for, Geo tours, not
      only gave me one of the best job opportunities of my life but also
      introduced me to my current girlfriend, who is spectacular. You reallly
      shouldnt need to know anymore.
